    This is a project built towards Smart India Hackathon 2022.
    We the team of 6 members build a Windows Service Application
        that tracks and reflect the changes in hardware devices like Keyboard, Mouse, Processor, Monitor, Memory, Harddisk,
        Monitor, Graphics Card etc.
        to solve the problem statement "An organization may have procured PC’s/ laptops/ workstations time to time. They may differ in configurations like RAM, hard disc storage and computing capabilities etc..,
Spares like keyboard, monitor memory, hard disk, graphics cards would have been changed / upgraded in due course but the changes don’t get tracked / reflect in the asset inventory."
